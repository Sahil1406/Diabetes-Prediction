# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
Diabetes Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various health parameters. The project leverages data analysis and predictive modeling techniques to provide accurate and actionable insights.

## Features
- Predict diabetes presence based on patient health metrics.
- User-friendly interface for inputting health data.
- Visualizations of data insights.
- Performance metrics to evaluate model accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains data related to female patients of Pima Indian heritage. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

### Dataset Features
- `Pregnancies`: Number of pregnancies
- `Glucose`: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- `BloodPressure`: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- `SkinThickness`: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- `Insulin`: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- `BMI`: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`: Diabetes pedigree function
- `Age`: Age (years)
- `Outcome`: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating absence or presence of diabetes

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahil1406/Diabetes-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Diabetes-Prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

2. Open the `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb` file.

3. Run the cells to execute the prediction model.

4. Input the required health metrics to predict diabetes risk.

## Accuracy

**The Accuracy of the model was very good at 77%**
